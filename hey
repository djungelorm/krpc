Hey!

Please excuse the unconventional approach, but wanted to get in touch!

I've used KRPC to create a number of KSP vessels and rovers (and videos, see https://studio.youtube.com/?utm_campaign=upgrade&utm_source=%2Fanalytics&utm_medium=redirect#/channel/UC8vfRY-7Px2Wp1xnaH088ag/videos).

Would love to collaborate and somehow include you, the brains behind all of this, in a video in some form. Let me know if you're interested!

Thanks,
Tom
